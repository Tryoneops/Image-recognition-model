# Image-recognition-model
This project demonstrates a simple image classification model built using Google's Teachable Machine. The model is trained to classify images into two categories: Blueberry and Orange.

The workflow includes:

Training an image recognition model using Teachable Machine

Exporting the model in TensorFlow Keras format

Writing a Python script to:

Load the trained model

Preprocess an input image

Predict the class (Blueberry or Orange)

Display the prediction and confidence score

The script is designed to run in Google Colab or locally using Python.
